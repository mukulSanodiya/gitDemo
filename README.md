What is a CRUD App
A CRUD app is a specific type of software application that consists of four basic operations; Create, Read, Update, Delete.

# Database
The database is where your data is stored. A database management system is used to manage the database.

# APIs
The APIs are how your application informs your database of what functions to perform. These functions can be modeled in different ways but they are designed to perform four basic CRUD operations; Create, Read, Update, Delete.
